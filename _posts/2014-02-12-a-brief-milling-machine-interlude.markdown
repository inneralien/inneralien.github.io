I contracted a small job to make some prototype face plates. I used my Sherline
milling machine to cut them out, and made a shortish video of the process. It
includes one tool change which always increases the complexity of a job, but is
kind of fun to program.

The program uses tool radius offsets and tool length offsets. This is the first
time I've used tool length offsets, and it worked great!

I'm using LinuxCNC on an IBM T42 laptop to control a Xylotex 3-axis driver
board.
