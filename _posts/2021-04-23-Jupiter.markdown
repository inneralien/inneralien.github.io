Two friends and I started Jupter Advanced Research in an attempt to measure
metabolically relevant levels of glucose in a human body via microwave
spectroscopy. Long story short, we partially succeeded but not enough to be
viable. We had an amazing time doing research, collecting data, and interfacing
with the great people at [OTRADI](https://www.otradi.org/) the bioscience
incubator in Portland.

_Of course I had to make the logo and cut out a door sticker!_

Since we were doing research we needed data, lots and lots of data. I created
an automated data collection system that would energize sample vials with a
range of frequencies and measure the resulting signals with an analog spectrum
analyzer. I used GPIB over Ethernet to automate all of the equipment in the
loop, so I could program ranges of frequency and power and collect everything
into a PostgreSQL database running on a server I built.

We discovered pretty quickly that the vial holder design was critical to
getting consistent measurement data.

After a lot of initial data we figured out where we wanted the antennas to be
and I laser cut a new vial holder design.

The vial holder design after the POC allowed antennas to be moved around
slightly to adjust signal strength. I made a mockup of the idea using Legos,
because I'm still that little kid. The antenna slides were functional too.

I cut many prototypes!

Eventually I developed a spring loaded mechanism that would hold a vial
precisely in the same position every time we inserted it.

I then incorporated this "spring" into a very solid design with fixed antennas.
