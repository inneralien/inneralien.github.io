It's been quite a while since I've added to this blog. It seems that life and
work have just swept me away and maintaining a blog was the highest priority.
Here is a little summary of some of the things I've been up to in the years
since.

I wanted to make a wall hanging for my wife, so I found a design that was close
to what I liked and then redrew it so that it could be successfully cut with
the laser.

To practice and verify the design I cut some scaled down versions out of
cardboard.

## Sewing and Lasers

I own an amazing Pfaff 1222E sewing machine and decided to combine sewing
and laser cutting.

This particular stitch uses a *lot* of thread, but is very appropriate for a
digital guy like myself.

For a couple years I was cutting fabric with the laser since it was excellent
at that task.

There are always some test cuts on cheap fabric or cardboard before committing
to the expensive stuff.

A friend who has a video gaming group was going to a tournament and wanted to
make a flag to display above his team. He sent me some drawings and I laser cut
the patterns and sewed the whole thing together. It came out amazingly well! He
said their flag was the envy of the other teams.

Cutting cardboard was always fun because it was so clean and quick, and
cardboard was always close at hand.

Cutting tiny strips of cardboard created these really great looking I-beams.

Cutting patterns in hard wood had great results as well.

The laser was also great at removing anodizing from aluminum.
