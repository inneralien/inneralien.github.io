Sometimes people would ask me if I could do small production runs of various
items. I cut man acrylic baseplates for PCB development systems, and a lot of
wooden trinkets.

I did several production runs of shuttle cock earrings for some extended family
members.

They turned out great!

The same folks asked if I could cut bracelets out of thick paper tubing. It was
a challange, but I managed. The software on the laser cutter had a flaw where
the rotary table wouldn't spin at the right rate, so I had to hand tweak the
firmware values to get this to work at all.

A friend that I worked with made some wooden bases for lights that he was
giving away as Christmas presents one year, and he asked if I'd be able to
engrave his logo into them. They turned out really nice.

Another friend was doing screen printing at the time and asked if I could cut
some UV masks for him.
